# ETH Guides

:warning: HAS NOT BEEN TESTED OR REVIEWED. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK :warning:

## Overview

For personal reasons, I want to switch from Prysm (Golang Implemenation) to Lighthouse (Rust implementation) for my ETH2 nodes. I also want to increase the client diversity. Therefore, I wrote a detailed guide to migrate from Prysm to Lighthouse (view the guide for more information).

This repo may eventually include more guides.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Ask smarter people to review my guide and then actually use it for myself
- [ ] (Possibly) Turn this into some fancy Jekyll Github Page
- [ ] Add more guides to this repo by either adding them myself or asking others for help
