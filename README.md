# ETH Guides

## Overview

For personal reasons, I want to switch from Prysm (Golang Implemenation) to Lighthouse (Rust implementation) for my ETH2 nodes. I also want to increase the client diversity. Therefore, I wrote a detailed guide to migrate from Prysm to Lighthouse (view the guide for more information).

This repo may eventually include more guides.
